# Simple Android group chat
 Android group chat uses Firebase Authentication, Database, UI and Cloud Messaging to share messages in a single chat room.

How to install:

#1. Download or clone this repository.
#2. Connect Firebase Authentication (I used email+password authentication), Database and Firebase Cloud Messaging services in Android Studio.
#3. Go to Cloud Messaging Firebase console and copy your API key to gradle.properties.
#4. In case of any build errors try to rebuild project, enjoy!
